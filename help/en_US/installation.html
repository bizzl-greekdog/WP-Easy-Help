			Currently <em>WP Easy Help</em> consists of two parts: a main help directory (not yet available, sorry),
			which goes straight into the wordpress root directory, and the actual plugin which goes
			to either <code>wp-content/mu-plugins</code> or <code>wp-content/plugins</code>. In the later case you also need
			to activate it.
			Custom help files go to the users upload directory into a new <code>help</code> directory.
			Plugins have to bring their own help files. This way they're always up to date
			with each plugins capabilities.

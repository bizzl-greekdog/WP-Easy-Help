		<p>
			<em>WP Easy Help</em> utilizes static html files, which at their best could also be used completely
			independent from the plugin. To seamlessly integrate them into the interface of the
			administration backend it scans and removes the <em>head</em>, deletes the <em>body</em>, <em>html</em> and any <em>DOCTYPE</em> tags
			and modifies all remaining <em>href</em> and <em>src</em> attributes pointing to local (from wordpress POV) files.
			At the moment <em>WP Easy Help</em> doesn't cache thoses cleaned files, yet.
		</p>

		<p>
			To figure out what to serve <em>WP Easy Help</em> uses an additional <em>GET</em> parameter (<em>entry</em>), which consists
			of the plugin name the help files belong to (or <em>wordpress</em> for general help or <em>you</em> for custom help)
			and the path of the files within the help structure (not including the <code>help</code> and the locale prefixes).
			It then searches for the file in several pathes inside the <code>help</code> directories, following this order:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>The current locale (see <code>get_locale()</code> in the wordpress codex) + the given path.</li>
			<li><code>en_US</code> + the given path.</li>
			<li><code>assets</code> + the given path.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
			If <em>WP Easy Help</em> can't find the file at any of these locations, it will display a simple, non-disruptive error
			message.

		<p>
			<em>WP Easy Help</em> is a wordpress plugin that embeds help files
			directly into the administration backend, making them easily accessible to most users.
			It separates this help into three parts:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>General help, which should mostly be for wordpress in itself and which in case of a network installation is visible to all users.</li>
			<li>Custom help, which is oriented towards individual users in a network installation, allowing the network operators to address special problems these users have.</li>
			<li>Plugin help, which is an accumulation of all help files belonging to special plugins.</li>
		</ol>

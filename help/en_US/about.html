		<p>
			<em>WP Easy Help</em> is a wordpress plugin that embeds help files
			directly into the administration backend, making them easily accessible to most users.
			It separates this help into three parts:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li><strong>General help</strong>, which should mostly be for wordpress in itself and which in case of a network installation is visible to all users.</li>
			<li><strong>Custom help</strong>, which is oriented towards individual blogs in a network installation, allowing the network operators to address special problems users of these blogs might have.</li>
			<li><strong>Plugin help</strong>, which is an accumulation of all help files belonging to special plugins.</li>
		</ol>
